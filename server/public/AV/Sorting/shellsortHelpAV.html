<h1>Shellsort Visualization Help Page</h1>
<p>
This is a visualization for Shellsort.
First you need to pick a series of increment steps.
Increments are space separated, each one must be smaller than the one
preceding it, and the last increment must be 1.
A default set of increments is provide, that you can just accept.
</p>

<p>
Next, pick an array size (the default is 8).
If you want, you can instead type some numbers (space separated) into
the "Array Values" field. The array will then be of the right size for
however many numbers you typed.
</p>

<p>
When you are done with these settings, hit "Run" to start the
slideshow.
You should see a series of bars show up, and you will also see a slide
counter that looks something like "1/56" to indicate that you are on
the first of 56 slides (the actual number of slides varies with the
array).
Clicking the arrow buttons advances through the slideshow.
You can reset the visualization whenever you want.
</p>

<p>
The little gear button at the top lets you control some options.
The most important one is the animation speed. If you think that the
display of the swaps is going too fast or slow, you can adjust it.
You can also make the values appear in an array as numbers, or as bars.
