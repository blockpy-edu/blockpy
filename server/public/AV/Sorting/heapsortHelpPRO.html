<h1>Heapsort Proficiency Exercise Help Page</h1>

<h2>Main action</h2>

<p>This exercise asks you to show the steps that would be taken by
heapsort.
Initially you are presented with a maxheap, and you must make the
steps that Heapsort would take on this input.
The things that you can do are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Swap two elements in the heap.
You do this by first clicking on one element (which will make the text
appear larger to mark it for you), and then on a second element (to
cause the actual swap to take place.
Remember that both the array and the tree that you see are alternate
views of the heap object.
So, you may click on an element either in the in the tree or the array
(either is fine), and the swap will display in both.

<li>
Decrement the heap size. This is done simply by clicking the
"Decrement heap size" button. The visual effect will be to shade the
last active node of the heap/last active cell of the array, which is
meant to indicate that this node/cell are no longer part of the active
part of the heap.
</ul>

<p>
If you make a mistake somewhere along the line, then your mistake will
be corrected for you, and you will lose that point.
To get credit for the exercise, you need to get a certain percentage
the total points correct (typically this is set to 90% of the possible
points).
</p>

  </ul>
  <li>The button with gears on it will let you set some options such as the animation speed (for the slideshow model answer).</li>
