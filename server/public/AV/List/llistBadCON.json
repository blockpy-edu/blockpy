A NULL pointer is indicated graphically by a diagonal slash through a pointer variable's box. The vertical line between the nodes labeled 23 and 10 indicates the current position (immediately to the right of this line).",

To speed access to the end of the list, and to allow the append method to be performed in constant time, <code>tail</code> points to the last node of the list. The position of the current element is indicated by <code>curr</code>.",
