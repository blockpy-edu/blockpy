      "av_c2": "This implementation is inefficient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of $\\theta(n)$ if there are $n$ elements.",
      "av_c3": "The other choice is have the top element be at position $n-1$ when there are $n$ elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the end of the list.",

      "av_c5": "For the implementation of <code>AStack</code>, <code>top</code> is defined to be the array index of the first free position in the stack. Thus, an empty stack has <code>top</code> set to 0, the first available free position in the array.",
      "av_c6": "Alternatively, <code>top</code> could have been defined to be the index for the top element in the stack, rather than the first free position. If this had been done, the empty list would initialize <code>top</code> as -1."
