<h1>Binary Tree Traversal Proficiency Exercise Help</h1>
<p>This exercise asks you to visit the nodes of the binary tree that
is dispayed in the same order as they would be visited by the
traversal function.
To do this, you will simply click on the nodes of the tree in the
proper order.
As you click on a node, a number will appear next to it.
If you click the wrong node, depending on the configuration that your
instructor set for the exercise, the correct answer will be shown and
you will lose the current point.
