<h1>Array-based Radix Sort Visualization Help Page</h1>
<p>
This is a visualization for the array-based implementation of Radix
sort.
You can just click the "Run" button and watch the slideshow.
But if you like, you can change the array size and/or number of digits
in the input values.
Or, you can instead type some numbers (space separated) into
the "Array Values" field. The array will then be of the right size for
however many numbers you typed, and the number of digits will match
the biggest value that you give.
</p>

<p>
When you are done with these settings, hit "Run" to start the
slideshow.
You should see some arrays show up, and you will also see a slide
counter that looks something like "1/56" to indicate that you are on
the first of 56 slides (the actual number of slides varies with the
array).
Clicking the arrow buttons advances through the slideshow.
You can reset the visualization whenever you want.
</p>

<p>
The little gear button at the top lets you control some options.
The most important one is the animation speed. If you think that the
display of the swaps is going too fast or slow, you can adjust it.
