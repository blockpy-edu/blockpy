<p><b>Login Failures</b></p>

<p>OpenDSA's score server uses an SSL certificate signed by Virginia Tech which your browser does not trust by default.  You must manually add a security exception for the score server.  To do so, simply surf to <a href="https://opendsa.cc.vt.edu" target="_blank">https://opendsa.cc.vt.edu</a> where you should be prompted with a screen saying that the SSL certificate is untrusted and asking whether you would like to add a security exception.  Follow the directions on the page to add the exception.  Afterwards you should be able to login.</p>

<p><b>If you see a message saying that "server cannot be contacted", or if you
see an exercise that shows "__ out of __" above it.</b>
</p>

Try the following:</br>

<p>The first step is to clear the browser cache, and then reload the page.</p>
      <ul>

      <li> On Chrome, open the settings menu and click "History", then "Clear
      Browsing Data". Clear "Cookies and oher site and plug-in data".</li>

      <li> On Firefox, open the settings menu, and click on the "History"
      icon. Then clear "Cache".</li>

      <li>After clearing as appropriate for the browser, reload the page.</li>
      </ul>
